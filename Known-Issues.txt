Known Deficiencies
------------------

The listed issues will be corrected in future versions.



#1:  
The main window title icon currently is not installed by "make install".
This results in error message "ERROR: could not open file /home/user/.gtkrc-2.0/icon1.png"
upon start-up of HAPviewer. This error does not impact the functionality of HAPviewer and, 
thus, can be safely ignored.

#2:
"make install" reports an error on missing doxygen documentation. To resolve this problem 
run "make doc" first, or ignore the message if you do not need the documentation.
